## 🚀 Project Idea

During campus placement seasons, many capable students get rejected not because they lack fundamentals, but because they miss **specific, trending skills** required by industry roles.

At the same time, colleges and placement cells usually realize these gaps **only after placements are over**, when corrective action is no longer possible.

**SkillSync solves this problem by:**
- Helping **students** identify missing skills *before* interviews
- Helping **colleges** view aggregated skill gaps across batches and departments
- Enabling **proactive training and curriculum interventions**

In short, SkillSync turns post-interview regret into **pre-interview preparation**.
